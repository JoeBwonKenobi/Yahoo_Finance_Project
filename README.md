 Web Scrapping Stock Prices from Yahoo Finance


This project shows how to scrape and clean financial data from Yahoo Finance using various Python libraries. Extracting specific components of the website using information from HTML. There are functions to parse the raw data, select five stocks, and export the data as a JSON file. I then made a simple visualization for the five stocks. The Five stocks I chose are as follows:

- QTUM

- BORR

- COST

- KOS

- CAT

# **QTUM Visual**

- This simply shows the ending stock price for QTUM which has not vaired too much since conception.

- This is a visualization of the change in stock prices for the CAT company.

# **Conclusion**

This information could be extremely usefull in building a predictive model for any one of these stocks. By changing the ticker,(abbreviated names if the stocks) I can scrape any live stocks price info from Yahoo Finance. This data can then in-turn be used to make a predicition model for predicting stocks. For more information please contact the email address below.
